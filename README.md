This platform's aim is to give a different perspective of what we do for saving what's left of the beauty of this planet.

The path to defeat the magnitude of the changes we made to our planet needs everyone to be on the same side, the side of the life.
We can't let ourselves fight between each other for each own selfishness, cause the only way we can solve this threat is by considering common interest in living above all the individual interests. We've caused this damage to the environment because of our impact as result of our actions and we need to stop pretending our own actions won't impact any other's life.

> If my actions can cause a loss of lifes somewhere else in the planet what kind of person I am when I perpetrate these actions?

Some people know they're choices would have a negative impact on our planet, our society and themselves eventually.

When it comes to the climate change, being someone who don't try to cooperate to the common goal, by lowering their impact on the planet or communicate what we're facing to people that don't have the whole picture in mind, is a damaging and negative weight for the part of society that believes in life.

For the leaders is even worse the damage they do by pretending to address the issues in the best way possible while they continue to perpetrate actions against the common interest of living.

At every level we have leaders that continue to act like if there's no an humanity emergency already growing that will expand its damages to every corner of the planet if we don't leave our greedy in the ground.

We want to give people a way to speak out a different truth, told by the other side of what mainstream communication gives audience, and cooperate to make the truth always bigger, till they can't more deny.
Also helping the justice to connect the dots in some stories that don't react the mainstream communication level.
